\section{News-media organisations with the largest number of tweets}

These large organisations produce a wealth of content that is viewed by a large number of consumers. While these organisations slow down entropy estimation due to their size, they easily converge during entropy estimation.

\section{News-media organisations with the smallest number of tweets}

These news organisations are the smallest tweet counts that have passed through our filtering processes. Each organisation here exemplifies abnormalities that are exhibited by many of these low activity organisations: \autoref{app:fig:TheLibRepublic} shows both the low overall activity (which makes entropy rate estimation difficult) and the presence of large spikes in activity; \autoref{app:fig:sciencedaily} shows a sustained low activity over the year, with clear weekend dips in activity; and \autoref{app:fig:Commentary} show a initial period of low activity paired with a later period of higher activity starting in August.
